# NETS213: Crowd vs Machine
## Contributors: Stefan Papazov, Nina Tansey, Hayley Sussman, Aidan Padala, Phillip Tchourioukanov
Repository for the NETS213 Final Project: Crowd vs Machine. This project aims to determine whether crowd wisdom or machine learning is more accurate in predicting home prices, specifically for homes in Austin, Texas.

## Major Project Components
### Preprocess data: 3 points
Obtain Austin TX Housing Price Dataset from Kaggle and create a Test Set and Training Set.

### Create HITs: 3 points
Create a HIT asking workers to guess the price of property based on dataset features. 

### Publish HITs on Mechnical Turk: 2 points
Publish the HIT on Mechanical Turk with the Test Dataset so workers can predict the prices of different houses.

### Create Neural Net: 3 points
Create a Neural Net Architecture to predict housing prices based on dataset features.

### Train Neural Net: 3 points
Train Neural Net on the Training Dataset to predict prices of different houses.

### Report: 3 points
Compare the performance of "crowd intelligence" vs. Neural Net predicting housing prices in the Test Dataset.
