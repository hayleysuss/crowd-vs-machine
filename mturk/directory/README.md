# MTurk Directory
## Written instructions for our MTurk tasks:
You are given the image of a house in Austin, TX and some information about it. Please open Zillow.com in a separate tab to search for houses matching these descriptions to get an idea about what such a house might cost. Then provide your best guess as to the cost of this home.
Our goal is to assess whether crowd wisdom or machine learning is more accurate in predicting home prices, so we have given you the same information that our machine learning model receives about a home. Please use as much of the information given as possible to make the best possible guess.
