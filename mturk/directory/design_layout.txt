    <strong>Instructions: </strong>
      You are given the image of a house in Austin, TX and some information about it. Please open Zillow.com in a separate tab to search for houses
      matching these descriptions to get an idea about what such a house might cost. Then provide your best guess as to the cost
      of this home.
    </p>
    <p>Our goal is to assess whether crowd wisdom or machine learning is more accurate in predicting home prices,
    so we have given you the same information that our machine learning model receives about a home. Please use as much of the information given as possible
    to make the best possible guess. </p>
    <p>Note that if a feature has the title "Has ___", 1 indicates that this home has that attribute and 0 indicates that it does not have that attribute. </p>
